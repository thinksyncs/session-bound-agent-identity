# Live Red-Team Completion Report

Copyright (c) 2026 ToppyMicroServices OÜ

This report is an evidence index, not an independent proof. Its conclusions are
limited to the checks and commits referenced below.

This report summarizes the completed live-style red-team work for the
session-bound agent identity profile. The normative profile source is
`docs/SSOT.md`.

## Status

Current mainline coverage is synchronized with `docs/SSOT.md` draft v0.4
as of 2026-06-21. The profile now includes direct-Agent JWT/JWS and CWT/COSE
verification, dependency-free live-style relay, HTTP/2 reuse, QUIC/TLS
early-data, route-assertion HTTP harnesses, deterministic malformed-token
corpus tests, a deterministic JWT acceptance invariant matrix, and local
Gateway Route Assertion validation.

Earlier branch-scoped implementation and verification completed on
2026-06-13. Additional local regressions were run on 2026-06-16 for
attestation-binder absence and Manager/Agent key-role separation.

- Implementation verification commit: `2ebd52694d88bef6d0a5e3fae2593ec9bfdf8647`
- GitHub Actions `Security Red Team` run #3 on that commit: success
- GitHub Actions `CI` run #3 on that commit: success

The gateway-routed profile is separate from direct-Agent mode because its trust
model is different: the gateway is the TLS endpoint and must authenticate the
gateway-to-Agent route before the intended Agent can be treated as accepted.
The Gateway Route Assertion claim map, final-Agent holder-of-key proof rules,
local policy gate, and JWT/CWT route-assertion adapters are now defined.
The local HTTP route-assertion harness now exercises route diversion and replay
across a request boundary. Runtime client/server gateway wiring remains
separate work.

The current evaluation is not a formal proof and is not a broad deployment
security claim. It is v0.4 evidence for checked fail-closed verifier behavior,
built from focused local checks, negative vectors, unit-level tests,
dependency-free live-style harnesses, and deterministic invariant checks. Claims
such as "this grant is accepted only for this session" still need real 0-RTT
application payload transport, broader deployment gRPC pooling, runtime gateway
wiring, longer randomized fuzz/property campaigns, and hardware-backed
attestation coverage before they should be treated as broadly validated.

## Verification Evidence

GitHub Actions:

## Claim-to-Evaluation Matrix

| Claim or attack class | Current evidence | Remaining evaluation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real network relay attack | Real TLS exporter binding is exercised in an in-memory TLS 1.3 harness. `TestVerifySessionIdentityJWTLiveRedTeamRejectsNetworkRelayAcrossEndpoints` runs two live loopback TLS endpoints and rejects a binding relayed from endpoint A to endpoint B. | Extend LRTT12 with an active forwarding proxy and deployment-specific TLS exporter material when the runtime server profile exists. |
| Borrowed attestation | Binder mismatch, missing binder, report-data mismatch, and nonce mismatch are covered in local tests. | LRTT11: generate hardware-backed evidence in a confidential-VM or equivalent environment and replay it across another session. |
| Token substitution and cross-JWT confusion | Covered by grant substitution and single-envelope JWT substitution tests. | Keep as regression coverage; add malformed serialization cases under fuzzing. |
| Same TLS connection with multiple tasks | `TestVerifySessionIdentityJWTLiveRedTeamHTTP2ConnectionReuse` runs task A and task B over one reused HTTP/2 TLS connection and rejects task A's binding in task B's request context. `TestVerifySessionIdentityJWTLiveRedTeamGRPCConnectionReuse` applies the same acceptance check over one reused gRPC `ClientConn`. | Add broader deployment gRPC pooling and cross-authority-scope cases. |
| HTTP/2 or gRPC connection reuse | The HTTP/2 and gRPC harnesses verify connection reuse, accepted same-context bindings, and rejected cross-context bindings. | Add deployment-specific gRPC pooling coverage when a product API is fixed. |
| TLS resumption and 0-RTT | `TestVerifySessionIdentityJWTLiveRedTeamRejectsTLSResumptionReplayAndPreBinding` establishes an initial TLS 1.3 session and a resumed TLS 1.3 session, derives exporter hashes from each, accepts fresh per-session binding material, rejects the initial Session Binding Statement on the resumed session, and rejects a pre-binding statement without `tls_exporter_sha256`. `TestVerifySessionIdentityJWTLiveRedTeamRejectsQUICEarlyDataAuthentication` exercises Go's QUIC/TLS early-data secrets, rejects authentication before `tls_exporter_sha256` is available, and accepts only after the finished-handshake exporter is bound. | End-to-end application 0-RTT payload behavior remains future work if a QUIC application profile is introduced. |
| Distributed replay race | Local goroutine race and local multi-process SETNX-style service are covered. | LRTT03b: repeat against real multi-node Redis or Valkey, including failover and timeout behavior. |
| Gateway route confusion | SSOT defines gateway route-assertion requirements, `docs/gateway-routed-profile.md` fixes the Gateway Route Assertion claim map and holder-of-key proof, `pkg/agtp/gatewayroute` rejects route, tenant, policy, task, target-Agent, nonce, audit-hash, replay, and missing-proof confusion, and `pkg/agtp` verifies JWT/JWS and CWT/COSE route-assertion wire tokens. `TestVerifyGatewayRouteJWTLiveRedTeamNetworkHarness` exercises route assertion verification across an HTTP request boundary and rejects route diversion and replay. | Add runtime gateway client/server wiring if gateway-routed mode becomes a product surface. |
| JWT/JWS parser robustness | Deterministic negative tests cover supported claim and signature paths. `TestVerifySessionIdentityJWTRedTeamRejectsMalformedCorpus` rejects malformed compact JWS, duplicate protected-header or payload JSON members, and unsafe control-character claims. `FuzzVerifySessionIdentityJWTRejectsMalformedCompactTokens` provides bounded fuzz smoke for malformed compact JWT/JWS inputs and passed a 60-second local fuzz run with 1,252,457 executions on 2026-06-30. | Add longer corpus jobs for Unicode, duplicate JSON keys, malformed base64url, malformed protected headers, and malformed JWS structure if broad parser-hardening evidence is needed. |
| Grant, binding, session, and expected-policy invariants | `TestVerifySessionIdentityJWTInvariantMatrix` enumerates grant hash, request context, TLS exporter, attestation binder, audience, role-separated context, task, replay, and local-policy invariants through the same JWT acceptance gate. | Add long-running property or fuzz generation if the project wants randomized invariant exploration. |

## Residual Boundaries

These are not blockers for the completed branch; they are profile or deployment
boundaries that need separate work if the project chooses to support them.

- Hardware-generated confidential-VM attestation evidence is not produced inside
  GitHub Actions.
- CWT/COSE verification exists in `pkg/agtp`, but client configuration is still
  wired for the JWT/JWS runtime path.
- Replay race coverage uses a local HTTP SETNX-style service, not a real
  multi-node Redis or Valkey deployment.
- Gateway-routed deployments now have a fixed route-assertion claim map,
  holder-of-key proof rules, a local policy gate, and JWT/CWT route-assertion
  adapters plus a local HTTP route-assertion harness. Runtime client/server
  gateway wiring remains separate work.
- HTTP/2 and gRPC connection reuse are covered locally; broader deployment
  gRPC pooling coverage remains separate work.
- TLS resumption and QUIC/TLS early-data authentication gating are covered
  locally; end-to-end application 0-RTT payload behavior remains separate work
  if a QUIC application profile is introduced.
- JWT/JWS and CWT/COSE malformed corpus tests plus bounded fuzz smoke and a
  60-second fuzz run are local regression gates, not long-running campaigns.
- LRTT17 is a deterministic invariant matrix, not a randomized property-test
  generator.
